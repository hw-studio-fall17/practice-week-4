### HELP! my cheeseburger disappeared! Fix my CSS!!!

My cheeseburger with a side of CSS should look like this:

![final-product](/images/cheeseburger.png)

* Look at all of the code in `index.html` and `style.css`
* DO NOT change any code in `index.html`
* Fix the code in `style.css` so that it is working properly
  * HINT: the code in `style.css` is mostly correct, but we are accessing the ids and classes incorrectly
* After fixing your cheeseburger, please answer the questions at the bottom of style.css


##### If you finish early...
* Add a `div` in the html with the `id = fries` and try to style the `div` in your CSS to look like french fries.

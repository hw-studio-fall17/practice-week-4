# Cheeseburger with a side of CSS

### HELP!, my cheeseburger disappeared! 

My cheeseburger with a side of CSS should look like this:

You can see that there is a lot of code is in `index.html` and  `style.css` file, but the code *is BROKEN* and you need to help me fix it! 

#### IMPORTANT! You will not have to edit any of the HTML! All of your fixes should be in style.css.

#### After fixing your cheeseburger, please answer the questions at the bottom of style.css


##### If you finish early...
* Add a `div` in the html with the `id = fries` and try to style the `div` in your CSS to look like french fries.

# Cheeseburger with a side of CSS

### HELP! my cheeseburger disappeared! 

My cheeseburger with a side of CSS should look like this:

* Look at all of the code in `index.html` and `style.css`
* You do NOT need to change ANY of the code in index.html
* Fix the code in `style.css` so that it is working properly
  * HINT: the code in `style.css` is mostly correct, but the way we are accessing the `classes` and `ids` is wrong
* After fixing your cheeseburger, please answer the questions at the bottom of style.css


##### If you finish early...
* Add a `div` in the html with the `id = fries` and try to style the `div` in your CSS to look like french fries.

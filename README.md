# Cheeseburger with a side of CSS

### HELP! my cheeseburger disappeared! Fix my CSS!!!

My cheeseburger with a side of CSS should look like this:



* Look at all of the code in `index.html` and `style.css`
* DO NOT change any code in `index.html`
* Fix the code in `style.css` so that it is working properly
  * HINT: the code in `style.css` is mostly correct, but we are accessing the ids and classes incorrectly
* After fixing your cheeseburger, please answer the questions at the bottom of style.css


##### If you finish early...
* Change the color of the text to yellow
* Add more HTML and style it in the CSS to add more toppings to your cheeseburger. Here's a cheeseburger with lettuce and tomato:
